^ak#cfzd【anthology】^bk#00(The Way to Buddhahood Verses)^ck1(Taking Refuge In The Three Treasures)^n0
Yin Shun (Yìnshùn; 5 April 1906 – 4 June 2005) was a Chinese Buddhist monk and scholar in the tradition of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism.
he was an advocate of the One Vehicle (or Ekayana) as the ultimate and universal perspective of Buddhahood for all, and as such included all schools of Buddha Dharma,
including the Five Vehicles and the Three Vehicles, within the meaning of the Mahayana as the One Vehicle.
Yin Shun's research helped bring forth the ideal of "Humanistic" (human-realm) Buddhism,
a leading mainstream Buddhist philosophy studied and upheld by many practitioners.
His work also regenerated the interests in the long-ignored Āgamas among Chinese Buddhist society,
He claims that Mahayana Buddhism can be divided into three systems.
They are: School of śūnyatā and name only (Madhyamaka), School of illusion and Vijñapti-mātra and School of genuine and permanent mind (Tathāgata-garbha).
^n1 The Sea of Existence has no boundaries,
The world is full of worry and suffering,
Flowing and turning, rising and falling,
Is there no place of refuge and support
^n2 “Acctmtlations of vealth and riches can be lost,
Those with fame and high status can fall,
Those who are together may be scattered,
Those vho are born mtst die.”
The well-governed state will fall into chaos,
The world once formed faces destruction
Of the pleasures and certainties of life,
None can be relied upon.
^n3 Ghosts and spirits delight in violent murder,
The desirous divine beings are addicted to various cravings,
The Brahma dwells on arrogance
None of them are place of refuge.
^n4 People seeking refuge everywhere,
Seeking refuge in all the ten directions,
Finally realize that the ultimate place of refuge
Is to be found in the most auspicious Three Treasures.
^n5 The true Dharma is the body of the Buddha.
His life is pure wisdom,
Like the bright moon shining through the autumn sky
Therefore, we should worship the Honored One of Two Perfections.
^n6 Buddhas of the three periods are innumerable,
Buddhas of the ten directions are also countless.
Having come to this impure world because of his compassionate vow,
Śākyamuni Buddha is deserving of our worship.
^n7 His wisdom is perfect, his compassion infinite.
Overcoming all obstructions, he is totally without remnants of habit.
These three virtues are equal and ultimate for all Buddhas,
But for the sake of skillful means, there are differences.
^n8 The empty well is old and in ruins
The empty village is quiet and without people
The far shore is forested and has flowing springs.
The Dharma, honorable and beyond desires, compels our worship.
^n9 The true Dharma is wonderful and inconceivable,
It is excellent, pure, permanent, and joyful.
If one follows the way of the ancient immortals,
One can attain Nirvāṇa.
^n10 To bring together the Saṅgha, the Buddha relied upon the Dharma,
And harmony, joy, and purity were its foundation.
With harmony in practical matters and harmony is principles,
The Saṅgha, most highly honored among assemblies, compels our worship.
^n11 One should respect the members of the Saṅgha,
And not scold them or judge them.
For they follow the Buddha as practitioners,
And maintain the true Dharma like fortress.
^n12 The real virtue of the Three Treasures,
Is faultless and pure in nature.
To transform the world, we should rely on both the real and the worldly virtues.
In this way, the Buddha Dharma can exist forever.
^n13 “All my life I vow
To take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha,
With utmost sincerity to make offerings,
And to be mindftl of all the extraordinary benefits.”
^n14 Taking refuge in this way
Is most highly honored and supreme.
Taking refuge in other things will not
Provide bliss and security.
^n15 The aforementioned taking of refuge is,
In essence, the faithful vow
Turning toward and following the Three Treasures,
Relying on them, people will be helped and saved.
^n16 If one vows to devote one’s life to them,
Through self-reliance and self-cultivation,
One can be unified with
The real meaning of taking refuge.
^ck2(Attending To The Dharma To Enter The Path)
^n17 By hearing one knows all dharmas
By hearing one can halt the advance of all evils
By hearing one can end meaningless matters
By hearing one can attain Nirvāṇa.
^n18 Like vessel to hold water,
Like seed to be planted in the ground,
One should avoid the three mistakes
By listening attentively, thoughtfully, and mindfully.
^n19 Think of oneself as being sick, in need of doctor and medicine
Thinking of the need to be treated intensively,
One should follow what one has learned and practice it.
The Buddha has said that the Dharma is like mirror.
^n11 One who follows the true Dharma
Should associate with benevolent people.
Such people, knowing the true nature of the Dharma,
Have the virtues of realization and teaching, As well as great compassion and eloquence.
^n21 Observing their virtues and not their shortcomings,
One should follow their advice without resisting.
The Buddha has said this lofty conduct is complete.
Good people should be respected by those who learn from them.
^n22 In order to listen to the Buddha Dharma, one must Avoid the three evil destinies,
Avoid being born in the Longevity Heavens
Be born in Buddha age and in the central countries
Have healthy sense organs and be without deviant views.
^n23 In the cycles of transmigration through birth and death,
It is hardest to become human.
The human abilities to recall, to have pure conduct, diligence and courage
Are superior to those of the various divine beings.
^n24 It is hard to become human, but having become human
One should vigorously practice the Dharma.
Do not waste timethis is like entering the mountain of treasure
And returning empty-handed and with regret.
^n25 So, after hearing the Dharma, one should vow to practice it.
But because of people’s different capacities, The Dharma may appear differently to each of them.
People of the lower grade want to have better future lives
And happiness in the present and in the future.
^n26 People of the middle grade vow to leave the three realms
And to enjoy the bliss of liberation in Nirvāṇa.
People of the upper grade vow to attain bodhi
With great compassion, wisdom, and ultimate bliss.
^n27 On the lower levels, upper levels can be built
But the higher levels include the lower ones.
because of people’uariots capacities, the Fiue and the Three Vehicles are different.
But to return to the ultimate, there is only one Great Vehicle.
^n28 So one should not become stuck at the middle or the lower levels,
Nor should one abandon them.
One should completely include them while progressing toward the Buddha Vehicle
And not slander the true Dharma.
^ck3(The Dharma Common To The Five Vehicles)
^n29 One who has the right faith and has taken refuge in the Three Treasures
Should cultivate right views
And practice right livelihood
Then it will not be difficult to make superior progress.
^n30 The aforementioned right views
Are the correct understanding of life.
^n31 Whether one’mind is pure or defiled,
Whether one’deeds are beneficial or harmful to others,
Whether one’actions are good or euil,
Buddhists should observe these questions carefully.
^n32 Karma can definitely lead to retribution or reward.
Karma can change from small to large,
Can guide or complete the stages to fruition,
Is both determined and undetermined,
And can bring retribution or reward now, in the next life, or in the more distant future.
No karma will be destroyed before retribution comes.
^n33 According to karma, good or bad results arise
In the constant transmigrations through the five destinies.
Restlts max be catsed bx seriots karma, one’dailx habits,
Or the thotghts of one’dxing moments.
The power of karma leads to future rebirths
Like the flames that continue to burn the wood.
^n34 Although birth and death continue among sentient beings,
The sages can find emancipation. 
The difference between ignorance and wisdom, One leading to bondage, the other to emancipation,
Should be believed deeply and without doubt.
^n35 Circulating within the five destinies,
The body and mind sustain much suffering.
^n36 The great extremely hot hells,
The peripheral hells all of which one must pass through,
The eight frigid hells and the solitary hells
These are the worst places for suffering beings.
^n37 There are all different kinds of animals
But all experience similar sufferingsbeing preyed upon or being enslaved.
^n38 Hungry ghosts always feel hungry and thirsty
And they use filth as food.
^n39 The evil destinies come from the unwholesome roots
That lead to evil deeds and their retribution.
^n40 Humans, vexed with suffering and happiness,
Are the pivot of ascent and descent.
Humans are the true pivots, not ghosts
But this traditional misconception about ghosts still lingers.
^n41 The first of the heavens is the realm of desire
Followed by the realms of form and formlessness.
Divine beings are physically superior and have the longest lives
Their joy and their concentration are also superior.
^n42 All suffering comes from bad karma,
And all bliss from the accumulation of good karma.
Suffering and bliss stop with the ending of karma,
So we should cultivate good karma diligently.
^n43 If one has the ability to do good
But has not built up good karma,
And suddenly bitter retribution arises,
Then what good can be done
^n44 Having wished to become human and having become human,
One should cultivate the Dharma of the Divine Vehicle without wanting to be divine being.
Also, one should cultivate the threefold fortunate karma diligently
And vow to be born when the Buddha is present.
^n45 Humans depend on the basic necessities of life to obtain happiness,
But these necessities are derived from previous charities.
Thus, for sentient beings, the Buddha
Always praises first the good fortune of giving.
^n46 One should give willingly and in ways that are beneficial to others,
Having compassion or respect in different circumstances.
There are differences in attitudes, in the fields of good fortune, and in the substances given,
And accordingly there are differences in the levels of merit.
^n47 One should give in proper way
And not from social pressure, from fear, or from indebtedness
One should not expect rewards or merely follow family traditions,
Nor should one ask for divine good fortune or for fame.
^n48 In order to control oneself for the benefit of others,
One has to be determined and patient in keeping the pure precepts.
^n49 Use one’ovn feelings to meastre those of others.
One should not kill or harm others,
Should not steal or engage in improper sexual conduct,
And should not make false statements.
Because drinking can destroy all virtues,
Buddhists should also keep the precept of not drinking.
^n50 To one who keeps the five precepts for life,
All good fortune will come.
^n51 For additional practice, there are the one full-day precepts
That follow the lifestyle of the practitioners who have given up lay life.
^n52 The ten good precepts are no killing, no stealing, no improper sexual conduct,
No lying, no backbiting,
No evil words or frivolous talk,
No greedy desires, anger, or deviant views.
The foundation of all good karma
Is these ten good deeds as explained by the Buddha.
These are the foundation for the good karma of divine and human beings,
Upon which the sacred Dharma of the Three Vehicles is established.
^n53 One should not be attached to sensual pleasures.
One should not be scattered and confused, for this brings all kinds of suffering.
One should be kind and persistent in keeping the pure precepts
And have conviction that practicing meditation is most blissful.
^n54 Practicing meditation means to regulate and concentrate on three things.
To haue one’mind foctsed in one state is called concentration.
Suffering and pleasure will successively cease.
Two Perspectives On Achieving The Four Dhyānas
^n55 The four dhyānas, the four formless states,
And the four infinite states,
Methods of meditation of concentration taught by the Buddha,
Should be practiced step by step.
^n56 Acts of charity are often impure.
Practicing meditation may lead only to self-benefit.
To aim for Buddhahood while still being human being,
Keeping the precepts is therefore the most important element.
^n57 For those whose minds are timid and fearful
The Buddha taught the practice of the six recollections
Being mindful of the Buddha, the Dharma, the Saṅgha,
The merits gained both by giving and by keeping the precepts, and the possibility of being reborn in heaven,
Is like entering the convergence of light,
 darkness will instantly disappear.
^n58 To have right recollection of Maitreya Buddha
And vow to be born in his Pure Land –
This method is most precious and rare.
It is very close, easily attainable, and open to all.
If one sees Buddha and always the Dharma,
Why should one worry about future regression
^ck4(The Dharma Common To The Three Vehicles)
^n59 All conditioned things are impermanent
So, says the Buddha, all sensations lead to suffering.
Because of this, one may grow weary, renounce the world,
And go toward the way of liberation.
^n60 Because such people have different capacities, the Buddha established Three Vehicles.
The main group for instruction and guidance, however, was the śrāvakas.
^n61 The way of liberation should be far away from
The two extremes of asceticism and pleasure seeking.
The Buddha, to accommodate those who wanted to have pleasure,
Allowed laypeople to remain at home to practice the Dharma
And, to accommodate ascetics,
He allowed them to leave home to be śramaṇas.
^n62 They may prefer to live by themselves alone
Or to live among people.
^n63 Their behavior may follow their belief
Or their behavior may follow their understanding.
^n64 Although they have different characters,
They can cultivate the renunciation of the world in similar ways.
^n65 The way of liberation as taught by the Buddha
Is the Four Truths and dependent origination.
All the profound Buddha Dharmas
Are evidenced by these.
^n66 Suffering, accumulation, extinction, and the Way
Are called the Four Noble Truths.
^n67 Suffering arises from not getting what one desires,
From associating with those who one dislikes and parting with those one loves,
From being born, becoming old, getting sick, and dying,
Which all come from the union of the aggregates.
^n68 These five aggregates are
Forms, sensations, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness.
Grasping consciousness, which exists everywhere,
Is contaminated and cannot be disentangled.
^n69 This also can be illustrated by the six sense organs,
Which, grasping external conditions, produce consciousness.
^n70 Or by the union of the six elements.
The suffering of the world derives from all these.
^n71 Suffering comes from the accumulation of karma.
Accumulation of karma comes from confusion,
Which can be triggered or nurtured by afflictions.
Encountering the right conditions will bring about the fruit of suffering.
^n72 Karma consists of the physical, verbal, and mental,
As well as the good, the bad, and the neutral.
The extinction of karma can be compared to seeds or perfuming
No karma will be lost in hundreds and thousands of kalpas.
Sentient beings, experiencing birth and death in accordance with their karma,
Cannot escape from the three realms.
^n73 The afflictionsdesire, anger, and ignorance
Are the roots of all evils.
Ignorance is like being drunk and confused,
The fault of anger is serious and that of greed is deep.
^n74 The Buddha, to include all the afflictions, points to
Self-centered views, self-love, ignorance, and arrogance.
Because of the attachment to “and mine”,
Birth and death will always continue.
^n75 Suffering and accumulation become entangled with one another.
Death and birth arise from dependent origination
Which has twelve links, as taught by the Buddha.
They are like castle or fruit tree.
^n76 Cloaked in ignorance,
Bound by the knots of desire,
The body with consciousness continues,
Ceaselessly continues.
^n77 Originating in consciousness there is name and form.
From these come the six sense organs.
The meeting of faculties and objects forms contact.
From contact comes sensation.
Through sensation arises desire.
Increasing desire becomes clinging.
Therefore they accumulate to form existence in the future,
And birth, aging, and death all follow.
^n78 To stop birth and death, confusion should be eliminated.
When it is extinguished, suffering ceases.
Being liberated from ignorance and desire,
One immediately realizes the bliss of stillness and extinction.
^n79 That which can eliminate suffering and accumulation
Is only the way of the One Vehicle.
The three studies and the eightfold right path
Can lead to Nirvāṇa.
^n80 First, the superior śīla,
With the power of pure mind
Can protect the mind from committing offenses
And each precept, by itself, is liberating.
^n81 The five and eight precepts for the laity
Are as described before.
^n82 The precepts for monastics are grouped into five
Śramaṇera, śramaṇerikā, Bhikṣu, bhikṣunī, and śikṣamaṇa.
^n83 Among these, the full precepts
Are the truly superior.
Receive these solemnly,
Guard them carefully, and do not lose or spoil them.
^n84 Violation of the four most serious precepts –
Killing people, taking what is not given,
Having sex, and telling serious lies –
Will destroy the nature of the śramaṇa.
^n85 The remaining precepts range from light to serious.
One should not conceal it if one violates precept.
After repentance, one can resume purity
With joy and without regret.
^n86 One who can keep the pure precepts
Will purify the threefold karma.
^n87 Closely guard the gates of the senses
Control the consumption of food and drink
Diligently practice wakeful yoga,
And live with right knowledge.
^n88 Be content and detached
So as to follow the vehicle of liberation.
^n89 All these can purify śīla
And be skillful means for achieving concentration.
^n90 To further the study of meditation
One should stay away from the five desires and the five hindrances.
^n91 Contemplation of impurity and controlled breathing
Are called the two ambrosias.
^n92 Following these to collect the mind,
One can attain right concentration.
The development of true wisdom
Comes from the seven dependable concentrations taught by the Buddha.
^n93 The study of superior wisdom is
Right understanding that transcends this world.
^n94 The Buddha told Ānanda that
The meaning of dependent origination is profound
When this exists, that exists
When this arises, that arises.
Everything is impermanent and has no self,
Having only worldly conventional existence.
^n95 When this does not exist, that does not exist
When this ceases, that ceases.
The empty and calm nature of dependent origination
Has an even more profound meaning.
^n96 Such was taught by the Buddha
Dependent origination from the perspective of the Middle Way
Is not attached to the view of either existence of nonexistence.
One can be liberated with such right understanding.
^n97 Right understanding also means
Insight into the Four Truths.
Knowing the Four Noble Truths as they are,
One should sever accumulation and practice the Way,
And should realize the extinction of the pain of confusion,
For from extinction one realizes Nirvāṇa.
^n98 First attain the wisdom that abides in the Dharma,
Then attain the wisdom that comes from Nirvāṇa.
Following conventional truth to align oneself with reality
Is the way of right understanding.
^n99 Right thought leads to renunciation,
To the abandonment of desire, and to extinction.
^n100 Right speech, action, and livelihood
Have pure precepts as their basic nature.
^n101 Start with upright views,
Follow through with pure conduct.
These in cooperation, like the eyes and the legs,
Can bring one to the other shore.
^n102 Right diligence can generally propel
One from mindfulness to right concentration.
Relying on concentration, the realization of wisdom arises
Having attained wisdom, one becomes emancipated.
^n103 All the grades of the Way as taught by the Buddha
Are grouped into thirty-seven.
The Wax is the same, the presentations uarx according to people’capacities,
Or they differ in the level of difficulty.
^n104 These are practices by the sages
And are realized by them.
The sages of the Three Vehicles
Experience the same emancipation and enter the city of Nirvāṇa.
^n105 Generally, along the way to emancipation,
One has to go through the planting, maturing, and liberating stages.
Realiyation from one’practice max be attained qticklx or slovlx,
But this does not depend on one’leuel of intelligence.
^n106 One who truly understands the true Dharma,
Is initially called śrotaāpanna.
The three bonds are completely cut,
And endless births and deaths are ended.
^n107 The second is called sakṛdāgamin.
Confusion is reduced through further practice.
^n108 The third is called anāgamin.
The realm of desire has been left behindthere is no returning.
^n109 One who completely cuts off all confusion
Is called an arhat.
Previous karma is ended, and new karma is not created
Nor is any condition for rebirth and death provided.
^n110 They may be liberated by their wisdom
Or be liberated completely.
Having the six supernatural powers and three insights,
The arhats are the superb fields of good fortune in the world.
^n111 Clear, pure, and always unmoving,
They are like the sun in the clear sky.
All their actions on earth
Are undefiled, like lotus flowers.
^n112 Those who are enlightened without teachers
And who live far away
Are called pratyekabuddhas.
Together with the śrāuakas, they are called the Two Vehicles.
^ck5(The Distinctive Dharma)
^n113 Ashamed for not knowing,
Ashamed for not being able,
Ashamed for not being totally pure,
The arhats should turn to and enter the Great Vehicle.
^n114 Not tolerating the decline of the noble teachings,
Not tolerating the suffering of sentient beings,
Through the arising of great compassion,
Enter into the Great Vehicle.
^n115 Some enter with the faithful vow
Some enter with wisdom, some with compassion.
^n116 Some enter as śrāuakas
Some enter as divine beings, some as humans.
^n117 Those who enter into the Great Vehicle
Do so either directly or indirectly.
The corresponding teachings
Are the real teaching and the skillful teaching.
^n118 Sentient beings have Buddha nature,
Which encompasses absolute nature (the fundamental principle)
And functional nature (the phenomenal developments).
Initially, relying on practice, they develop this nature.
Then, relying on this nature, they become more practiced.
Only through practice can all become buddhas.
^n119 Having made the resolution, one can be called bodhisattva
Who presides over all sentient beings.
The worldly and world-transcending virtues
All come from the bodhisattvas.
^n120 The vehicle of the bodhisattvas
Corresponds with bodhi mind,
Is guided by kindness and compassion,
And has the wisdom that comes from emptiness as its skillful means.
Enter by these three important gates,
And cultivate all practices skillfully,
For they all lead to the One Vehicle to become Buddha.
The Three Gates Of The Great Vehicle
^n121 The bodhisattuas’ “places of learning”,
Having the ten good deeds as their foundation,
Are included in the three cumulative precepts,
Which all the seven classes of disciples can keep.
^n122 Withdrawal and loss of bodhi mind,
Jealousy, stinginess, anger, and arrogance
Obstruct the acts of benevolence
And violate the precepts of the Great Vehicle.
^n123 Altogether, the bodhisattva way includes
The six transcendences and the four all-embracing virtues.
By entering the different grounds gradually,
One makes complete the virtues of buddha.
^n124 For the benefit of all sentient beings,
The body, all usable things,
And all good dharmas of the three periods,
Should not be saved but should be given away.
^n125 Lower people give for the sake of themselves.
Middle people give for their own liberation.
Those who give all for the benefit of others
Are called great people.
^n126 The giving of wealth, dharma, and fearlessness
Is difficult but should be sympathetic and sincere.
The joy that comes from hearing of the need to give
Is superior to the happiness of Nirvāṇa.
^n127 Something should not be given
If you are unable, others are unreasonable, or requests are invalid.
^n128 The resolution to renounce is the superior aspect of bestowing,
So one should always practice this mental joy.
^n129 When attached to the three wheels,
Giving is described as worldly.
Giving that is not connected to the three wheels
Is called the world-transcending pārāmita.
^n130 Keeping the precepts puts an end to the injury of others
And gives rise to universal fearlessness.
^n131 Breaking the precepts is the root of all problems
Such as evil destinies and poverty.
Keeping the precepts is the root of threefold goodness
better future, decidedly superior fruit,
And – by keeping the pure precepts for the benefit of others –
Entrance to the Great Vehicle.
^n132 Those who accept and keep the pure precepts
Should guard them as if they were life preserver.
They should not look down on those who break them
Or be obsessed with keeping or breaking them.
^n133 To embrace and protect sentient beings,
Bodhisattvas practice the transcendence of patience,
Tolerating hateful insults, calmly accepting suffering,
And carefully observing the Dharma.
^n134 What benefit is there is being angry at others
It increases the sorrow and suffering of oneself and others.
The fire of anger burns up the roots of goodness
While patience encompasses the five virtues.
^n135 The transcendence of giving, precepts, and patience,
Mostly taught to the laity,
Are the provisions for accumulating vast blessings
And the cause for physical body like that of Buddha.
^n136 The transcendence of diligence as taught by the Buddha is
The provision necessary for the attainment of blessings and wisdom.
One’mind shotld be insatiable, as uast as the ocean
Euen vhen one’strength is ewhatsted, one’mind should never stop.
^n137 The obstructions are procrastination, attachment to worldly pleasures,
Self-disparagement and timidity.
^n138 Because of the difficulty of achieving buddhahood,
The long period of births and deaths,
And the vast provisions needed,
One must train the mind not to retreat or give up.
^n139 Those who are timid and inferior,
Wish to have an easy path to practice.
^n140 The Buddha has special skillful means
To embrace and protect these beginners.
^n141 Of these, one of the most special
Is to be reborn in the Most Blissful Land.
Blessed by the power of Amitābha Buddha,
They will not retreat from attaining enlightenment.
^n142 For those who cannot renounce worldly pleasures
But wish to attain enlightenment,
The Medicine Buddha vowed compassionately
To provide Pure Land in the east.
^n143 Superior understanding, strong will,
Joy and rest are the four powers.
If one cultivates them,
One can easily be diligent.
^n144 All the superior virtues of the Three Vehicles
Come from concentration and wisdom.
^n145 Those who practice cessation and contemplation
Should first practice putting the scattered mind to rest,
When cessation is achieved, contemplation is also achieved.
This rule of practice is the proper sequence.
^n146 Relying on the abiding mind can produce the ability
Both to undertake and to accomplish what needs to be done.
^n147 Right concentration comes from extinguishing the five faults
By diligently practicing the eight cutting actions.
^n148 Laziness, the barrier to concentration,
Can be counteracted with faith, diligence, aspiration, and tranquility.
^n149 Right mindfulness of the object to which one has become accustomed
Can keep the mind from being scattered.
Remembering clearly by not losing mindfulness,
The object of focus abides calmly and is revealed clearly.
^n150 The objects of mindfulness taught by the sages
Are able to purify the mind of illusions,
To correspond with the truth,
And to lead to renunciation.
^n151 In the Great Vehicle, most people practice
Mindfulness of buddha and mindfulness of breathing.
^n152 Mindfulness of buddha comes from focusing the mind
On real buddha, not on statue of buddha.
To settle the mind by contemplating the form of buddha
One should be familiar with various skillful means.
^n153 Mindfulness of breathing includes counting, following, and stopping.
The breathing should not be blustery or gasping, nor should one feel the breathing.
^n154 Realizing the presence of stupor or restlessness,
With right knowledge, stop the mind from being scattered.
^n155 To eliminate such problems and take action,
One should not follow or be influenced by them.
^n156 When these problems have been overcome, simply practice straightforwardly,
And thus avoid the mistake of using too much effort.
^n157 Inward abiding and continuous abiding,
Calm abiding and abiding nearby,
Harmonized abiding and quietude,
Followed by supreme quietude,
Single-pointed concentration,
And maintaining equanimity without action –
These methods of cessation, taught by the sages,
Are the nine stages of mental abiding.
^n158 If one attains wonderful light bliss in practice,
This can be called the achievement of cessation.
^n159 In concentration clarity, non-differentiation,
And wonderful light bliss
Can be attained by Buddhists and non-Buddhists
But concentration differs in terms of the wisdom that comes from contemplation.
^n160 The Prajñāpārāmita
Is nobly superior,
Because all liberation relies on it
And all buddhas come from it.
^n161 The direct realization of enlightenment comes from practice,
And practice comes from thinking and learning.
Virtuous friends and further learning
Are to be relied on for the development of wisdom.
^n162 Prajñā is fundamentally nondual
Hoveuer, the practice uaries because of people’different capacities.
The sūtras and treatises on prajñā
Are the closest guides for the practitioners of prajñā.
^n163 All buddhas, following the two truths,
Teach sentient beings the Dharma.
Following the conventional truth, one can attain the ultimate truth
Following the ultimate truth, one can attain liberation.
^n164 Everything that is conventionally established in the world
Can be recogniyed bx “name and speech” consciotsness.
Names, perceptions, and things are conventional,
But the conventionally true and false should be skillfully differentiated.
^n165 How does inherent nature exist
This can be discovered by wisdom in accord with the ultimate truth.
^n166 Suffering comes from confusion and karma,
Which come from discrimination.
Discrimination evolves from meaningless elaboration
Meaningless elaboration can be eliminated by the contemplation of emptiness.
^n167 All things arise from causes and conditions.
What arises conditionally is empty, without an inherent nature.
Being empty, all things are neither born nor extinct,
But are always in perfect stillness.
^n168 thing cannot arise by itself or through another
It cannot arise from the two together or without cause.
Contemplating the empty nature of things
One can know that no thing has ever arisen.
^n169 The self is neither identical to the five aggregates
Nor is it separate from the aggregates.
They do not belong to or coexist with each other.
For these reasons it is known that there is no self
^n170 If there is no self, no “I”,
Hov can there be “mine”
The nature of all things is empty,
So of course the self is too!
^n171 Karma and confusion stem from discrimination.
Discrimination comes from the mind,
And the mind depends on the body.
Therefore, contemplate the body first.
^n172 Knoving there is no “” or “mine”,
Dissociating from everything, internal and external,
Extinguishing all discrimination,
One is in accord with reality!
^n173 Real nondiscrimination
Should not lead to erroneous schemes.
The meditation on the mean
Is to be done without the discrimination of inherent nature.
^n174 Relying on the right understanding of emptiness,
Investigate and dwell in tranquility.
With cessation and contemplation complementing each other,
One can skillfully enter calmness and extinction.
^n175 Excellent is the true prajñā!
Excellent is the true liberation!
Following this unparalleled and holy wisdom,
One can perfectly complete all virtues.
^n176 The nature of the Dharma has never been dual
But is presented differently under different conditions.
Whether system of thought reveals the whole truth or not,
Wise people should skillfully make their own decision.
^n177 All things arise from conditions.
Dependent origination has no inherent nature and is empty.
Because it is empty, it has to arise in accordance with conditions.
Thus are all things established.
The meaning of the Middle Way in both existence and emptiness
Has been discussed above.
^n178 All things are without an inherent nature.
Those who skillfully understand will be able to understand this.
But for those who have not accomplished the five deeds,
The Buddha repeatedly explained the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra.
^n179 Either there is no inherent nature
Or there is inherent nature.
^n180 Dependent origination that has inherent existence
Is baseless discrimination.
Based on consciousness, dependent origination can be established
And then cause and effect can be well founded.
^n181 Things outside the mind are nonexistent,
And the mind’consciotsness is not, in principle, nonewistent.
Realizing that false external objects are manifested through mere consciousness,
One can enter reality.
^n182 Some cannot think that the law of arising and extinction
Cannot be the foundation of being bound and being liberated
because thex are afraid of the phrase “the nonewistence of the self.”
Therefore, the Buddha again embraced them with skillful means.
^n183 The profound Tathāgatagarbha
Is the bases of good and evil.
^n184 Being permeated by residual habits from beginningless time,
Tathāgatagarbha is called ālaya.
From it there is birth and death
And the realization of Nirvāṇa.
^n185 The Buddha taught that the empty nature of things
Is Tathāgatagarbha.
True suchness is undifferentiated,
And should not be mixed with non-Buddhist views.
^n186 With every transformation, these skillful means become more admirable
While the empty nature of things remains non-dual.
The wise should skillfully integrate them
As one pure Way.
^n187 The way to ripen all sentient beings
Is through the four all-embracing virtues taught by the Buddha
Giving, affectionate speech,
Beneficial conduct, and working together.
^n188 One should initially cultivate the bodhi mind
And then practice the ten good deeds.
When bodhi mind is firmly set,
One can enter the way of the Great Vehicle.
^n189 Relying on various superior understanding and practices,
And richly accumulating the two provisions,
After one countless kalpa
One can enter the level of sages.
^n190 Upon entering the first ground, that of extreme joy,
bodhisattva is born into the Tathāgata’familx.
Having cut the three bonds,
Such bodhisattva has the supreme virtue of giving.
^n191 The bodhisattva, by keeping the precepts complete and pure,
Enters the undefiled ground.
^n192 At the radiant ground, bodhisattva with superior patience
Attains the wisdom that eliminates all darkness.
^n193 Completely diligent in cultivating the branches of enlightenment,
The bodhisattva enter the ground of blazing wisdom, In which the view of the self completely disappears.
^n194 Upon entering the ground that is difficult to overcome, with superior concentration
The bodhisattva can skillfully understand all the principles of the truth.
^n195 The sixth ground is the ground of manifestation.
The bodhisattva with superior wisdom and in the concentration of complete extinction
Will see, with clarity, all Buddha Dharmas 
And the true nature of dependent origination.
Such constant stillness and compassionate mindfulness 
Surpasses that of the Two Vehicles.
^n196 At the ground that goes far, in the concentration of complete extinction,
Each thought can alternate between being in and out of concentration
The transcendence of skillful means is like strong fire
That ends the second countless kalpa.
^n197 Entering the motionless ground,
Without form and without effort,
The bodhisattva cuts off all confusion of the three realms.
Such bodhisattva’great vows are extremely pure.
Through illusory Saṃādhi
The bodhisattva appears in different forms throughout the three realms.
^n198 At the ground of good wisdom, with unhindered understanding,
The bodhisattva completes and purifies all powers.
^n199 At the tenth ground, that of the Dharma cloud,
All btddhas shover light tpon the bodhisattua’head.
With increased wisdom, and pouring the rain of the Dharma,
Like great cloud the bodhisattva helps the good grow.
^n200 The way cultivated by the bodhisattva
Passes through three countless kalpas and ten grounds.
Whether bodhisattvas become buddhas suddenly or gradually
Depends on their different capacities.
^n201 When three countless kalpas are completed,
The bodhisattva ascends to the ground of wonderful enlightenment.
^n202 The body of buddha is of utmost stillness and extinction,
Impartial and without discrimination.
Like maṇi pearl,
It has wonderful effects that benefit all sentient beings.
^n203 In the body that flows out of the nature of things,
Everything appears moment after moment
The phenomena of buddhas, of bodhisattvas,
Of the Two Vehicles, of all sentient beings,
Of the three periods of time, and of all the ten directions.
The dependent and the direct consequences coexist without conflict.
From one, everything appears
And everything enters into one.
^n204 The ten powers, the fourfold fearlessness,
The eighteen distinctive characteristics,
Great compassion, the threefold karma that needs no guarding,
And wonderful wisdom are the virtues of buddhas.
^n205 buddha, abiding in Pure Land,
Has eighteen perfections, and,
Together with all bodhisattvas,
Enjoys the bliss of the Dharma.
^n206 The true meaning of all the Dharma
And the wisdom that realizes the truth
Are unchanging and undifferentiated.
Therefore, there is no other Vehicle.
^n207 The buddha, having attained the motionless body
And having compassionately vowed to save the beings of the three realms,
Appears in pure or defiled lands
To enable all to enter Nirvāṇa.
^n208 In order to relieue people’ewhatstion,
lovely city is magically created.
Eventually the true form is revealed.
Therefore, there is only on Buddha Vehicle.
^n209 All good Dharmas
Lead toward the Buddha Way.
Therefore, all sentient beings
Can ultimately become buddhas.
