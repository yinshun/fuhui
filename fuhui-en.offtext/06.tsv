1	The Chinese word here is 信 (xìn) and is commonly translated as “faith.” However, we have chosen to use the word “confidence” to avoid confusion with the concept of “blind faith,” and to bring out the deeper meaning of the word, which includes confidence, trust and so on, towards the Triple Gem and the teachings of the Buddha.
2	Śrāvakayāna: Technically, it refers to the practices of the śrāvakas or direct disciples who heard the Buddha’s teaching in person. However, in our translations this term is used to refer to the Hīnayāna, which in general refers to the Buddhist practices that are centered on self-salvation. Historically, the term is applied to the early Indian groups typified by Theravādins 上座部 and Sarvâstivādins 有部, who held to a monastically centered approach to Buddhist practice. The term Hīnayāna is considered derogatory, and so we have chosen to use Śrāvakayāna instead.
3	Saṃsāra: A term used to refer to the cyclic existence of sentient beings. In Sanskrit it means “course, passage, passing through a succession of states, circuit of mundane existence, transmigration, metempsychosis, the world, secular life, worldly illusion.” See Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 1899, page 1119.
4	Buddha-dharma: From the Chinese 佛法 (fófǎ), the use of this term by Venerable Yinshun can have several meanings, including Buddhism and the Buddha’s teachings. In our translations we use the term “Buddha-dharma” to translate 佛法 when it is referring to the Buddha’s teachings.
5	Ultimate benefit refers to all the benefits that come with the attainment of liberation from cyclic existence, which are lasting and not temporary.
6	Dharma: Has several meanings. When used with a capital “D” it refers to the ultimate truth and the Buddha’s teachings, which help sentient beings to realize that ultimate truth. When spelt with a lowercase “d”, dharma can refer to phenomena, things, method or practice.
7	Nāgārjuna: A bodhisattva in South India who lived during the late 2nd century CE. He is regarded as the founder of the Madhyamaka school and is highly regarded by many Buddhist schools.
8	Inter-faith dialogue has improved greatly since the 20th century. The situation explained here by Venerable Yinshun is based on his own experience when the various Christian faiths began to assertively spread their religion in China.
9	The example of calling one’s parents and whistling are Chinese cultural traditions.
10	「信是什麼？「心淨為性」，即內心的純潔，不預存一些主觀與私見，惟是一片純潔無疵的心情。」（《佛法概論》，p. 185）“What is confidence? A [temporary state of] undefiled mind is its essence.” This is the purity of the mind where not a single thought of subjectivity or selfishness arises. There is simply a state of mind, which is pure without any flaws.
11	Sun Yat-sen, 1954, The Principle of Nationalism: Lecture One: “What is a principle? It is an idea, a faith, and a power. When men begin to study into the heart of a problem, an idea generally develops first; as the idea becomes clearer, a faith arises; and out of the faith a power is born. So a principle must begin with an idea, the idea must produce a faith, and the faith in turn must give birth to power, before the principle can be perfectly established.”
12	Prajñā: A Sanskrit term that means “wisdom;” in particular, it relates to wisdom concerning the ultimate truth.
13	Level of faith with understanding: The stage at which a practitioner has both faith and understanding in the Buddha’s teachings—adhimukti, or correct faith, complete understanding.
14	Level of understanding with practice: A stage after faith with understanding at which correct faith and understanding of the Buddha’s teachings are put into practice and guide all actions— adhimukti-caryā.
15	Bhūmi: A Sanskrit term with many meanings. In Buddhism it means a metaphysical step, degree, or stage. In this translation we use it to refer to the stages in the final ten stages of the bodhisattva path before the attainment of Buddhahood.Bodhisattva: A practitioner of the Mahāyāna who has made the bodhi vow to help all sentient beings gain liberation from suffering while seeking the ultimate goal of Buddhahood.
16	Arhathood: The ultimate goal in the Śrāvakayāna, where the practitioner attains liberation from cyclic existence through enlightenment.
17	Note here that “accomplishment of undefiled confidence” means that the undefiled confidencebecomes firm and steady.
18	Stages of engaged effort: In the Śrāvakayāna, prior to entering the four stages of fruition, where liberation becomes guaranteed, there are four stages of engaged effort: stage of warmth, stage of summit, stage of receptivity, and stage of the supreme worldly Dharma. Only after reaching the stage of receptivity is confidence steadfast, such that there is no more fear of regression.
19	Non-regression: In the Mahāyāna, a bodhisattva’s final stages of practice are split into groups of tens in the order of the ten levels of faith, ten levels of abiding, ten levels of practice, ten levels of dedication, and ten bhūmis (stages). One’s confidence becomes steadfast after accomplishing the ten levels of faith and reaching the first level of abiding. However, it is not until the ten bhūmis that non-regression is attained, and the goal of Buddhahood is assured.
20	Mahāyāna: The name attached to a late Indian sectarian movement that became the main form of Buddhism in East Asia.
21	Bodhi vow: The vow and aspirations of all bodhisattvas, which is to help all sentient beings gain liberation from suffering while seeking the ultimate goal of Buddhahood. A person cannot be considered a bodhisattva if they have not made this vow.
22	Dharmakāya: This is the body of the truth, as realized by the buddhas. It is one of the three bodies of a buddha and is unmanifested, unlike the physical body of a buddha.Seed of the dharmakāya: The cause that will result in an awakening to the ultimate truth.
23	Flower Sūtra, Fascicle 40: “Moreover good man, [when] referring to one who extensively practices generosity [it means] that in all the endless worlds: in the multitude of buddha fields, as many as motes of dust in the ten directions, and in each buddha field there are multitudes of buddhas, as many as motes of dust, and each buddha is surrounded by many congregations of bodhisattvas. On account of the power of Samantabhadra’s vows and practice, [when] deep faith in and understanding of [the buddhas] arise, [we are] able to see them before us. Then with the most superb items as gifts, we make offerings.” 《大方廣佛華嚴經》卷 40：「「復次，善男子！言廣修供養者：所有盡法界、虛空界十方三世一切佛剎極微塵中，一一各有一切世界極微塵數佛，一一佛所種種菩薩海會圍遶，我以普賢行願力故，起深信解，現前知見，悉以上妙諸供養具而為供養。」(CBETA 2019.Q1, T10, no. 293, p. 844c24-28)Venerable Yinshun, Pureland and Chan Schools: “In the Chapter on Samantabhadra’s Practice, the [practices of] paying respects to all buddhas, praising the buddhas, and extensively making offerings (to buddhas) is similar to the [practice of] recollecting the buddhas (whether visualizing or reciting the buddha’s name). This is a unique religious practice because it is a method for practicing and accumulating the merits of a buddha, as well as a method for repentance.” 《淨土與禪》：「〈普賢行願品〉的禮敬諸佛、稱讚如來、廣修供養（佛），即與念佛（觀想或稱名）相等。此為特殊的宗教行儀，因為這是修集佛功德的方便、懺悔的方便。」(CBETA 2019.Q1, Y17, no. 17, p. 68a5-7)
24	The story of Brahma requesting the Śākyamuni Buddha to teach the Dharma occurred soon after Prince Siddhārtha attained Buddhahood. At that time, the Buddha knew that what he had realized was so profound that many would find it hard to understand and accept. So he was hesitant about teaching the Dharma. Brahma, knowing a buddha had appeared in the world, came to Śākyamuni Buddha and requested that he teach the Dharma. The other story occurs toward the end of the Buddha’s life. At that time, Ānanda was his personal attendant. The Buddha did tell Ānanda that if someone asked the Buddha to remain, then Buddha could extend his life span. However, some records say that Ānanda was so aggrieved by Buddha’s impending death that he simply did not understand, and missed the opportunity to make that request. 
25	Samādhi: A Sanskrit word meaning concentration: and which refers to meditative states in which the mind is able to maintain durations of singular focus on an object.
26	Flower Sūtra, Fascicle 40: “When bodhisattvas are able to concur with the wishes of all beings, that is the same as concurring with the practice of making offerings to all buddhas. When bodhisattvas respect and willingly serve other beings, that is the same as the practice of respecting and serving the buddhas. When bodhisattvas cause sentient beings to be happy, that is the same as the practice of making all the buddhas happy. Why is this so? Because the essence of all buddhas is grounded in the mind of great compassion. It is because of sentient beings that great compassion arises; it is because of great compassion that the bodhi vow arises; it is because of the bodhi vow that Buddhahood can be achieved. This is just like a great tree in a barren desert. If the roots can tap into water then the branches, leaves, flowers and fruits will flourish. The bodhi tree in the wilderness of life and death is the same. All sentient beings are like the roots of the bodhi tree while the buddhas and bodhisattvas are like the flower and fruits. When the waters of great compassion nourish sentient beings then the flower and fruits of wisdom—buddhas and bodhisattvas—will ripen. Why? Because all the buddhas and bodhisattvas use the waters of great compassion to benefit sentient beings. Only in this way can they accomplish anuttara-samyak￾saṁbodhi (unexcelled complete enlightenment or Buddhahood). Therefore, bodhi (enlightenment) derives from sentient beings, without sentient beings all bodhisattvas would never accomplish unsurpassed enlightenment.” 《大方廣佛華嚴經》卷 40：「菩薩若能隨順眾生，則為隨順供養諸佛；若於眾生尊重承事，則為尊重承事如來；若令眾生生歡喜者，則令一切如來歡喜。何以故？諸佛如來以大悲心而為體故。因於眾生而起大悲，因於大悲生菩提心，因菩提心成等正覺。譬如曠野沙磧之中有大樹王，若根得水，枝葉、華果悉皆繁茂。生死曠野菩提樹王，亦復如是。一切眾生而為樹根，諸佛菩薩而為華果，以大悲水饒益眾生，則能成就諸佛菩薩智慧華果。何以故？若諸菩薩以大悲水饒益眾生，則能成就阿耨多羅三藐三菩提故。是故菩提屬於眾生，若無眾生，一切菩薩終不能成無上正覺。」(CBETA 2019.Q3, T10, no. 293, p. 846a10-22)
