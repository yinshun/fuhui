^bk06【Confidence and Its Cultivation】^ck1(Why We Need Confidence)^n1
The factors leading someone to learn and practice Buddhism vary. 
For some people, it may be confidence (faith), ^f1 while for others it may be compassion or wisdom. 
Nevertheless, confidence is considered the most important factor leading individuals to gain entry into Buddhism. 
In the complete process of learning and practicing Buddhism, which is the process of confidence, understanding, practice, and realization,
 confidence is the first and primary element.
^n2 In the Śrāvakayāna,^f2 it is said that “confidence enables one to enter [into Buddhism], while morality enables one to transcend [saṃsāra].”^f3
 In the Mahāyāna, it is said that “confidence enables one to enter [into Buddhism], while wisdom enables one to transcend [saṃsāra].” 
Although it is fine that there are differences between whether it is morality or wisdom that enables someone to transcend saṃsāra,
 it is consistent that “confidence enables one to enter [into Buddhism]” and that it cannot be lacking.
Therefore, if we want to learn and practice Buddhism, and rely on the Buddha-dharma^f4 to attain ultimate benefits,^f5
 we cannot neglect the cultivation and strengthening of confidence. 
If we are unable to establish sincere and pure confidence in the Triple Gem,
 then we are not on the path connected to the Buddha-dharma and are merely wandering outside the path of Buddhism.
^n3 Soon after he attained Buddhahood, the Buddha thought to himself, “How can someone understand this deep and profound Dharma ^f6 that I have realized if they have no confidence [as their basis]?”
 At that time, the Buddha thought that explaining the Dharma would not be easy,
 and so he reflected that it was only by having confidence that someone would be able to accept and practice the Dharma. 
Nāgārjuna^f7 uses a simile to explain this point: 
People who have no hands are unable to take away any treasure from a treasure trove. 
Likewise, if people have no confidence in the Triple Gem when they see the Buddha and hear the Dharma,
 then in the end they would not have attained anything. 
Accordingly, we can see that the boundless merits of the Buddha-dharma all stem from confidence. 
Hence it is said, “Confidence is the foundation of the path and the mother from which all merits [arise].”
 That is how important confidence is!
^n4 At one time, the Buddha wanted to teach the people in a fishing village along the Ganges. 
He manifested a person to walk on the water, from one side of the river to the other. 
Seeing this, the villagers were shocked. 
The manifested person remarked, “What is so special about walking on water? This is merely because I have confidence in what the Buddha teaches.”
 Consequently, the people in the fishing village developed great confidence toward the Buddha and he was able to go to the village and teach them. 
^n5 It is recorded that around 500 to 600 years after the Buddha’s time, Peter, a fisherman,
was caught in a storm while out at sea. 
Suddenly he saw his teacher, Jesus, walking on the surface of the water. 
When Jesus beckoned him, Peter jumped off the boat and walked toward Jesus. 
But then he recalled the storm and became afraid. 
Jesus reproached him for not having enough faith!
 This story from the Holy Bible parallels the story of the Buddha and the fishing villagers,
 and similarly highlights the power of confidence.
^ck2【Right Faith (Confidence) and Blind Faith】^n6
When talking about religious beliefs, we must first discuss the difference between “right faith” (confidence) and blind faith. 
Indeed, it is difficult to distinguish between the two, but it is necessary to clarify each in turn. 
Among the different religions, there is a tendency to criticise the others as promoting superstition. 
^n7 For example, Roman Catholic and Orthodox denominations of Christianity pay homage to the Virgin Mary and erect carvings or images of Jesus on the Cross. 
Some religious followers bow down to the ground and pray to “Our Father in Heaven,”
 while others pray to God for help when they are ill. 
However, they criticise the Buddhist practice of paying respect to the Buddha through various statues as being superstitious. 
They do not attempt to understand the other religion (Buddhism), and try to suppress or erase it instead. 
They are just blindly rejecting Buddhism.^f8
 An objective answer to the question of what is right faith and what is blind faith cannot be attained from theists with these perspectives.
^n8 Blind faith and right faith, or confidence, can be distinguished from two aspects. 
One is from the aspect of the object in which someone places their faith. 
All right faith must have an object that possesses the qualities of being real, virtuous, and capable. 
Take, for example, having confidence in the Buddha. 
The Buddha was a historical figure who lived in ancient India and was known as Śākyamuni. 
He indeed possessed the virtues of an awakened one because he had the virtue of wisdom,
 which is great awakening, the virtue of pacification,
 which is the ending of all defilements,
 and the virtue of benevolence, which is great compassion. 
The Buddha accomplished the absolute perfection and purification of human nature and so is most worthy of our confidence and respect. 
The Buddha is our teacher and, because of his virtues, he is able to guide us toward the wholesome practices of liberation. 
We can attain the same liberation as the Buddha. 
^n9 Hence, the Buddha is real, and has virtues and capabilities. 
He is worthy of our confidence and respect, and we should respect and believe in the Buddha. 
Therefore, having confidence in the Buddha is having right faith. 
Now, let us look at the alternative concept of the creator of the world. 
There is no proof that this creator, God, is real. 
It is said that God bestowed food and drink upon humans,
but this is also unverifiable. 
So, despite having a form and ability that is uncertain, some people believe in God. 
Is this not superstitious?
^n10 Another example of blind faith is that of a traveller at night using the method of calling for their parents or whistling to build up their courage when scared of ghosts.^f9
 Although this may have a strong effect on the traveller,
 it is certainly not the case that their parents or the act of whistling has the ability to deter ghosts. 
Therefore, in theistic religions, in which the belief in a creator is unquestionable, self-reassurance and self-delusion can arise from the power of blind faith in an external being. 
A devoted and concentrated mind can bring about special spiritual experiences. 
Both self-assurance and special experiences can yield strong effects. 
However, these still belong to blind faith if we regard that effect as an act of God or the grace of God. 
But there is no need for theists to lose hope. 
Blind faith does have some value (of course, it could also be harmful). 
Having blind faith is not necessarily bad. 
At least it is much better than having no faith at all.
^n11 The second aspect from which to distinguish confidence and blind faith is the factors connected to the mind, through which one’s faith arises. 
If someone undergoes a process to properly understand things and then is able to see them correctly and believe in them sincerely, then this is faith with wisdom or right confidence. 
If someone blindly follows something or naively has faith in it by following their parents or friends, then this is definitely blind faith.
^n12 Four situations regarding right faith and blind faith can be derived from these two aspects.
The first is where the object of faith has the qualities of reality, virtue, and capability but the subject (person) adopts this faith blindly. 
This is just like a certain medicine that truly has healing effects from a specific disease. 
Although the patients do not understand the potency of the medicine,
 they trust the doctor and so they take the medicine. 
This situation can still be considered as right faith. 
However, it is not ideal because there is potential for harm (for example, the doctor may be unreliable or incompetent). 
Therefore, it is said, “having faith without wisdom will increase ignorance.”
^n13 The second situation is where the object of faith does not have the qualities of reality and capability
 but someone’s faith in that object arises after investigation or giving some consideration, or contemplation, to it. 
This may look like “faith with wisdom.” However, it is undeniably a kind of blind faith. 
The reason is that such blind faith is due to an incorrect understanding,
 which is based on an incorrect contemplation.
^n14 The third situation is where the object of faith has the qualities of reality, virtue and capability,
 and someone’s faith in the object is due to correct contemplation,
 which is the most precious type of right faith (confidence). 
^n15 The fourth situation is where the object of faith does not have the qualities of reality, virtue and capability,
 and the person believing in that object just blindly follows what others say. 
This last situation is the worst case of blind faith.
When learning and practicing the Buddha’s teachings,
 we should aim to have right faith, where both subject and object align. 
Suppose the ideal case is not possible, then we can still be considered a Buddhist disciple with right faith if we believe in the Triple Gem—cause and effect, wholesome and unwholesome deeds, and the three life cycles, despite not having a correct understanding of them.
^ck3(Submissive Faith and Confidence)^n16
The faith or confidence we have discussed above applies to general situations. 
When the Buddhist scriptures mention faith, generally this is a reference to confidence in the Buddha-dharma. 
Therefore, among the Buddhist schools from the north-west of India,
 such as the schools of Sarvāstivāda and Yogācāra,
 when they discuss confidence, it has to be pure and wholesome. 
In fact, confidence is not simply wholesome and pure. 
This is why the schools of Mahāsāṃghika and Vibhajyavāda from the south-east of India categorize confidence into two typesthat include what is wholesome and unwholesome.
^n16 The first type is submissive faith, which is similar to the common belief in a certain ideology. 
Such faith can be wholesome, unwholesome, or neutral. 
Take adherents of militant as an example. 
We cannot say they have no beliefs,
 but rather that their beliefs lead to impure and unwholesome deeds. 
^n17 The second type of confidence is pure and wholesome. This is taught specifically in Buddhism.
I recall that Liang Shuming once said that the characteristics of western culture are connected to religion and faith,
 while the characteristics of Chinese culture are connected to ethics and rationality. 
However, Liang Shuming did not take note of Indian culture,
 especially the Buddhist culture there, where religion and philosophy are interconnected. 
The characteristic of Buddhism is that confidence and rationality are in accord; confidence and wisdom function as one. 
^n18 According to Buddhism, faith is clearly inclined to the emotional aspect. 
However, the object in which someone places their faith is expected to be understood through wisdom. 
Although the function of wisdom is to understand, the knowledge gained is not merely abstract and baseless. 
What is realized does have a true substance that is worthy of reverence and respect. 
In Buddhism, even though confidence and wisdom have their own special qualities, and Buddhists may have their own inclination toward one or the other,
 the two are not completely unrelated or contradictory. 
That is to say, confidence is rational, and this rationality embodies confidence in Buddhism. 
This point can be fully brought to light through an explanation of confidence.
^n19 What is confidence? “A [temporary state of] undefiled mind is its essence”.^f10
 This definition is very difficult to comprehend,
 and we need to explain it based on the causes that lead to the arising of confidence and the results that are borne from having confidence. 
In terms of the perspective of causes, it is said that “deep recognition” is a profound understanding. 
In other words, it is a “superior understanding.”
 Because an understanding that is profound and powerful can initiate confidence,
 hence it is said that “the cause of confidence is superior understanding.”
 In terms of the perspective of results,
^cut(Where there is confidence (faith), there must be vows or eagerness. )
 it is said that “aspiration is the fruit of confidence.” “Aspiration” is a vow or eagerness to fulfil one’s goals.^paste
This logic is basically similar to Mr Sun Yat-sen’s advocation, 
“upon having an idea, one will have a faith and upon having a faith, one will have power.”^f11
This confidence arises through deep understanding and sincere aspiration. 
In other words, this confidence is brought about by wisdom and is able to stimulate aspiration.
^n20 Confidence is defined as a temporary state of undefiled mind.  This is its essence.
Confidence is an affinity and respect that is sincere and without defilement. 
This confidence has a power that is able to cause the mind to become settled and clear. 
That is why this confidence is likened to a water purification tablet that can be used to purify dirty water. 
Once this confidence arises, one’s mind becomes settled, clear,
 free from doubts and overflowing with genuine esteem for the Triple Gem. 
On account of being able to truly see the virtues of the Triple Gem and having thorough confidence in it,
 Buddhists themselves definitely seek to realize the Buddha-dharma through practice.
Therefore, we can see that the unbiased confidence taught by the Buddha arises from wisdom and is starkly different from the faith in theistic religions.
^n21 The followers of western theistic religions have faith but they place little emphasis on rationality. 
In their spiritual life, wisdom is unnecessary. 
Scientists who focus on materialism may have knowledge but no faith. 
The two parties have created conflicting ideologies. 
Some people believe that maintaining traditional Christian values have the benefit of stabilizing society. 
Nevertheless, many are unable to properly harmonize faith and rationality in their lives. 
As a result, for six days of the week they live as atheists and then on Sunday they attend church to present a life of sincere faith in their God for the day. 
In this way, the religious life and the rational life are mechanically and forcefully brought together. 
Subsequently, an internal identity crisis develops. 
It is no wonder that the hysteria of human emotions and the sufferings in our present time are continually becoming more severe.
^n22 In China, there is the philosophy of “knowledge and practice function together”,
 or “practicing when knowing” (which in fact are inspired from Buddhist teachings). 
These philosophers argue that if someone’s knowledge is not gained from their practices, that knowledge is not true knowledge. 
Yet, they fail to understand that if someone regards their knowledge as an abstract knowledge and treat it as a tool for survival rather than embodying that knowledge as part of their being,
 then there is no guarantee that they will be able to apply that knowledge to their lives.
It is a must that one’s confidence and vows are developed on a foundation of wisdom. 
This is the only way to ensure that one will put things into practice. 
In other words, if confidence and wisdom do not function as one,
 then it is impossible for knowledge to be put into practice. 
The Buddhist right faith that is based on the mutual enhancement of confidence and wisdom is the true panacea that all human beings desperately need at this moment.
^ck4(Confidence from Recognition, Confidence with Eagerness and Confidence from Realization)^n23
Confidence is essential, not only at the start but also at the end of the spiritual path toward enlightenment. 
Over the course of practicing the Buddha-dharma, confidence pervades the person’s spiritual practices as they progress. 
Regarding the practitioner’s progression, from beginner to advanced,
 the prajñā path can be divided into three stages.^f12
^n24 Stage 1 is confidence emerging from acknowledgement, or recognition of the Buddha￾dharma. 
This confidence is an undefiled faith in the Buddha-dharma that develops from a deep understanding of the Buddha-dharma. 
It is at this point that right faith is accomplished. 
This is the confidence that emerges when undefiled faith resonates with one’s clear understanding of the Dharma. 
It is the level of “faith with understanding.”^f13
^n25 Stage 2 is confidence with eagerness. 
In this stage, confidence can transform into diligent practices on the basis of right faith; that is, confidence from acknowledgement.
Over the course of affirming one’s confidence and merging with understanding to the eagerness for practicing the Buddha-dharma,
 confidence becomes stronger as the practitoner progresses closer to their goal. 
This is the level of “understanding with practice.”^f14
^n26 Stage 3 is confidence from realization, or realization of purity. 
This is where one realizes the truth as a result of practicing the Dharma. 
The undefiled faith developed in stages 1 and 2 may have resulted from listening to the Dharma teachings (to know by authority of the scriptures),
 or from inference with logic (to know by inference). 
It is only at this third stage that one is able to attain “realization without relying on others,” or realization “without reliance on language.”
 Here, one can penetrate the truth by perceiving directly through the senses, and this is the level of “awakening.”
 According to the Mahāyāna, the confidence at this [third stage] is the bodhisattvas’ “mind with pure and lofty intentions,” which is achieved at the first bhūmi.^f15 
According to the Śrāvakayāna this is the “four realizations of purity”, or the “four indestructible confidences,” which are attained at the first fruition stage of Arhathood.^f16 
At this stage, our confidence in the buddhas, Dharma, saṃgha and noble precepts, which we have believed in all along, is absolute and completely free of any doubt.
^n27 ^n It is not difficult for practitioners to attain an instance of undefiled confidence in stage 1. 
The difficulty lies in the accomplishment of undefiled confidence. ^f17 
For Śrāvakayāna practitioners, undefiled faith is accomplished at the stage of receptivity,^f18
while for bodhisattvas it is attained at the first stage in the ten levels of abiding. 
In the stages preceding that of receptivity in the Śrāvakayāna, such as the stage of summit, practitioners also have some degree of confidence,
 but it is not yet firm and steady. 
^n28 Similarly, in the ten levels of faith that precede the ten levels of abiding for bodhisattvas,
 the confidence is described as being like a feather blown about by the wind. 
Even though a practitioner’s confidence is undefiled at these preceding stages,
 it is not steadfast and has not attained the level of non-regression.^f19 
When we develop our confidence, the aim is to make undefiled confidence arise and grow. 
Moreover, we must develop our confidence to the point from which we no longer regress. 
If a practitioner is unable to attain superior understanding toward the Triple Gem and the four noble truths,
 then they will be unable to attain the Buddhist undefiled confidence (right faith).
^n29 Even though the Triple Gem and the four noble truths possess the qualities of being real,
 virtuous and capable, beginners may not necessarily have right faith, but if they are able to have blind faith or submissive faith towards the Triple Gem etc.,
 such faiths can be regarded as right faith in Buddhism,
 and they are an essential component when learning Buddhism. 
But, strictly speaking, if confidence (faith) does not arise from superior understanding of the Dharma,
 it remains unable to reveal the special quality of Buddhism’s right faith.
^ck5(Definitive Path and Provisional Path)^n30
Definitive Path
The very first stage of learning and practicing right faith involves the initiation,
 practice and then accomplishment of undefiled confidence. 
This very first stage also has two approaches. 
^n31 One is the definitive path to developing confidence. 
Right faith must be accompanied by right aspiration. 
In the Śrāvakayāna, the aspiration is to leave this cyclic existence as soon as possible,
 whereas in the Mahāyāna^f20 it is the bodhi vow.^f21
^n32 In the Mahāyāna, the typical method for developing right faith is to cultivate confidence in the buddhas, Dharma and saṃgha,
 which must also be supported by the practices of generosity, morality, tolerance, diligence, tranquillity, and insight. 
This is taught in the Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahāyāna. 
From this we can see that the Mahāyāna aspiration of benefiting oneself and others is only accomplished through the cultivation of actual deeds and understanding of the teachings. 
In other words, confidence is not a stand-alone practice. 
Rather, it is interconnected with all sorts of wholesome deeds,
 and is developed and accomplished in reliance on practicing such wholesome deeds.
^n33 Regarding the bodhi vow taught in the Buddhist text, the prajñā path has three phases. 
The first is the bodhi aspiration, then comes the bodhi practice,
 and last is the bodhi realization (or bodhi wisdom). 
The first two phases are also known as the “worldly bodhi vow,”
 and the last phase is the “transcendental bodhi vow.”
 When the bodhi vow is said to be signless and beyond words,
 this is referred to as transcendental bodhi vow.
When the bodhi vow is said to be accomplished through great compassion,
 then that is from the position of bodhi practice. 
The vow that a newly initiated Mahāyāna practitioner cultivates is from the position of bodhi aspiration,
 which is to seek the Buddha’s awakening and help deliver sentient beings from suffering.
^n34 Beginners are required to learn and contemplate, over and over,
 the endless suffering of all sentient beings,
 and the true benefits and relief that Buddhism can bring to sentient beings and the various merits of developing the bodhi vow. 
This is the most effective way to motivate someone to develop the Mahāyāna aspiration. 
Once the Mahāyāna aspiration becomes strong,
 the practitioners should then take up the bodhisattva precepts. 
This is exactly the bodhi aspiration, which is also the seed of the dharmakāya. ^f22 
The bodhi vow is the only fundamental rule, or precept, for bodhisattvas. 
To take up the bodhisattva precepts is to make the vow. 
When we practice according to the precepts, we will be able to gradually progress and then accomplish the Mahāyāna’s right faith.
Provisional Path
^n35 The other path to cultivatation of right faith is called the “provisional path.”
 This is the practice method that caters to bodhisattvas who are faith-inclined. 
When someone who is spiritually weak begins to practice the Dharma (Mahāyāna) and wishes to develop right faith,
 they especially focus on reverent faith and rely on the powerful blessings of the buddhas to help them develop right faith. 
Nāgārjuna said that this is an approach that enters the Buddha-dharma through the door of diligently cultivating faith (vow). 
To take such a provisional path is to delightedly accumulate the virtues of the buddhas and seek rebirth in a pureland. 
^n36 The most complete teaching on the provisional path would have to be the ten great vows found in the Chapter on Samantabhadra’s Practice in the Flower Sūtra. 
Given that a buddha is one who perfectly realizes unsurpassed bodhi,
 on the provisional path one’s aspirations revolves around the Buddha gem as its basis for practice.
Among the ten great vows, the first vow is to pay respects to all buddhas,
 while the second vow is to praise the buddhas. 
Both of these are the basic courtesies a disciple would undertake if they met with a buddha. 
The third vow is to extensively make offerings to the buddhas,^f23 
which is a proper way to accumulate merits when meeting with a buddha. 
The sixth vow is to request that the buddhas teach the Dharma,
 while the seventh vow is to request that the buddhas to remain in this world. 
These two vows originate from the events when Brahma requested the Śākyamuni Buddha to teach the Dharma,
 and Ānanda did not ask the Śākyamuni Buddha to remain in this world, respectively.^f24 
All of the aforementioned vows are derived from the events in relation to Śākyamuni Buddha’s life,
 and then extended to all buddhas.
^n37 The fourth vow is to repent for past unwholesome actions. 
The way to practice this vow is, for example, to repent by recollecting the name of a buddha. 
This method is found in the Sūtra on Definitive Monastic Code. 
The Mahāyāna practice of repentance is performed by both monastics and lay practitioners,
 and therefore the saṃgha’s procedures for repentance are not applicable. 
Rather, the focus is on repenting in front of the buddhas. 
The fifth vow is to rejoice in the merits of others,
 and the tenth vow is to dedicate our merits to all beings, universally. 
These two items are specifically valued in the Mahāyāna. 
The eighth vow is to practice in accord with the Buddha’s teachings,
 which means to learn and practice the causal deeds toward Buddhahood, and the virtues of buddhas. 
The ninth vow is to always concur with the wishes of sentient beings, and this is to nurture compassion.
^n38 These ten great vows have three major and special qualities. 
The first quality is that all buddhas are equal. 
Therefore, the practice can focus on one specific buddha (for example, Vairocana) or on all the other buddhas in infinite space and across the entire cosmos. 
It is not limited to a buddha in a certain time and place. 
^n39 The second quality is the emphasis on mental practice (visualisation or contemplation). 
Not only are the vows relating to repentance, rejoicing and dedication undertaken through mental practice,
 even the vows of paying respects, making offerings and praising the buddhas are carried out mentally. 
This is shown in the sayings, “[When] deep faith in and understanding of [the buddhas] arise,
 [the buddhas’ images] appear as if before our eyes,” and “[When] deep faith in and understanding of [the buddhas] arise, [we are] able to see them before us.” 
These are all the provisional paths of recollecting the Buddha in the mind,
 and when these are accomplished the attainment is the samādhi ^f25 of recollecting the buddhas. 
^n40 The third quality is that the ten vows specifically rely on the virtuous outcomes of Buddhahood, including the virtues of the Dharma and saṃgha, to develop confidence;
 that is, everything arises on account of the Buddha’s virtues. 
Take as an example the compassion, in terms of the ninth vow, of concurring with the wishes of sentient beings: 
“When bodhisattvas are able to concur with the wishes of all beings,
 that is the same as concurring with the practice of making offerings to all buddhas. 
When bodhisattvas respect and willingly serve other beings,
 that is the same as the practice of respecting and serving the buddhas. 
When bodhisattvas cause sentient beings to be happy,
 that is the same as the practice of making all the buddhas happy. 
Why is this so? Because the essence of all buddhas is grounded in the mind of great compassion.” ^f26 
This third quality is inclined toward faith and thus is similar to the logic in Christianity whereby people should love others because God loves them.
^n41 The practice of bodhisattvas who are faith-inclined is to focus their confidence and vows on the buddhas,
 such that they recollect the buddhas in every single thought.
 Without forgetting the Amitābha Buddha, they then can attain rebirth in the Western Pureland of Amitābha, in accordance with their vow. 
Such a practice is regarded as a provisional path because it focuses on confidence and vows, which are just mental practices. 
Nevertheless, such mental practices can initiate action. 
When one’s thoughts never depart from the virtues of the buddhas and each thought always wants to learn from the buddhas and concur with the wishes of sentient beings,
 then as one’s confidence and vows develop,
 so shall one naturally initiate the greater practices of compassion and wisdom for the sake of protecting the Dharma and benefiting all beings. 
^n42 Nāgārjuna says that practicing the provisional path enables one to 
“nurture and grow their merits while their minds become gentle and supple … 
After developing confidence in the boundless, profound, pure and great virtues of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, [one will] empathize with all sentient beings”
 and undertake the six perfections.
So, although the ten vows belong to the provisional path,
 which is a practice for bodhisattvas who are inclined to faith,
 the Mahāyāna practitioners of ancient India also undertook the practices of repentance, rejoicing, requesting and dedication when they paid their respects to the Buddha in their daily practice sessions. 
The only difference is that bodhisattvas who are compassion-inclined and wisdom-inclined place greater emphasis on the practices of compassion and wisdom, respectively.
^n43
