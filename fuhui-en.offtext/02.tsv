1	The five kinds of turbidity refers to (1) the turbidity of age, where sentient beingsâ€™ life expectancy reduces dramatically and this is met with corresponding calamities of famine, pestilence, and conflicts, all of which no one can avoid. (2) Turbidity of view, which is where the true dharma disappears, and false dharmas begin to arise, while evil views grow stronger. People no longer carry out good deeds. (3) Turbidity of affliction is where beings are overcome by the many defilements of greed, lust, stinginess, confrontations, lying, and so forth. They adopt evil ways to create mental distress. (4) Turbidity of living beings is the time when beings delight in evil, do not respect their parents or elders, and have no fear of retribution, and so they do not create merit or undertake deeds to help others. (5) Turbidity of life span is where humans no longer enjoy the long life spans of the ancients. Due to the evil they create, their life span dwindles, and it would be extremely rare for people to live to one hundred. 
2	This transformation of impure into pure refers to departing this impure world and gaining rebirth in a pureland.
